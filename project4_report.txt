2. Catalog information about Index
- Show your catalog information about an index (tables, columns). 
Index information are tableName and attribute.


3. Block Nested Loop Join (If you have implemented this feature)
- Describe how your block nested loop join works (especially, how you manage the given buffers.)

I have a std::map<Key, vector<Record>> to work as a hashtable for searching.
I have a vector<Record> to store last buffered join result.
Key is a class which store a single attribute.
Record is a class which store the entrie *data record. 

If the map is empty, then  load records with size of PAG_SIZE * numOfPages in to a std::map from leftInput->getNextTuple().

Then, keep calling rightInput->getNextTuple() and check whether condition matches.
Since there might be more than a record with the same key, buffer all results in a vector. Next time, it can directly check whether there is a available result in vector and thus having good amortized time complexity.

If rightInput->getNextTuple return QE_EOF, clear std::map and load another PAG_SIZE * numOfPages in to map again.

 

4. Index Nested Loop Join (If you have implemented this feature)
- Describe how your grace hash join works.


5. Grace Hash Join (If you have implemented this feature)
- Describe how your grace hash join works (especially, in-memory structure).


6. Aggregation
- Describe how your aggregation (basic, group-based hash) works.



groupBy:

I have a map<Key, pair<char*, float>> to store the map of each group attribute and their according value.
Key is a class which store value and type of the group attribute.
for MAX MIN SUM: char* point to the actual value with its null indicator.
for COUNT AVG: float store the actual count with this group attribute.

when I got a tuple from getNextTuple, first got the current group value with this specific key.
Then update according value in that group.

When getNextTuple() is called, return the group attribute and according value. 
In addition, using a iterator to maintain the last return position.

7. Implementation Detail
